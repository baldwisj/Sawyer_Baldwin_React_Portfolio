# Sawyer_Baldwin_React_Portfolio

This is a portfolio website intrended to display biographical information and a miriad of work from Sawyer Baldwin.

## Description
This website was created with my knowledge of React, CSS, and HTML that I have gain throughout this bootcamp. The largest factors of success through my own eyes is the implementation of component links, props, and event handling. Up to this point, these skills have proved to be the most challenging.

## Usage
This webpage was created to showcase the work of Sawyer Baldwin and provide a biography for prospective future employers to view and analyze. This page currently consists of six projects over the course of the past six month. Post graduation I will further polish and add to this portfolio.

## Conclusion
Durning my creation of this webpage I have learned and sharpened many of my coding skills. These skills include:

* Re-familiarized myself with basic CSS and HTML.

* I gained a working knowledge of how react works.

* I gained a better understanding of component linking.

* I acheived a better understanding of linking and inter-file relationships

* I now have a more thorough understanding of event handlers through react.
